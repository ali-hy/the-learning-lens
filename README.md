# The Learning Lens

Our goal is to use immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to improve educational and training experiences. While our specific use case focuses on enhancing the process of Lego building, our broader objective is to create a modular and adaptable framework that can be applied to various educational and training scenarios.

## Pre-development Documentation

Our documentation (mostly made up of diagrams) is currently split over multiple files. You can find the specific diagrams in the following files (all documentation files can be found in the docs/ directory):

1. [Architecture](docs/architecture-diagram.md)
2. [Use-case diagram](docs/use-case-diagram.md)
3. [ERD](docs/erd.md)
